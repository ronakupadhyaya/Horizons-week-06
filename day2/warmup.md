# Warmup Exercise: Fizz Buzz React edition

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to solve a very common programming interview
question using React.

## Instructions

FizzBuzz is a basic programming question asked in many interviews. It involves
printing an increasing sequence of numbers and if statements in React.

1. Open [this CodePen project](http://codepen.io/moose-horizons/pen/zBzQvK?editors=0010),
   fork it so you can save your work.
1. Make `<FizzBuzz />` display a bulleted list (`<ul>`) of `n` numbers
   (n is a prop).
1. If a given number is divisible by 3 paint it red (CSS `color: red`),
   if it's divisible by 2 paint it blue, if it's divisible by both 2 and 3
   paint it purple. If a number neither divisible by 2 or 3, then display it
   in black.
1. Your solution should look like this:
