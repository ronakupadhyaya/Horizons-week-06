# Part 1: Install React Development Tools
Install the React Developer Tools extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi).

This extension allows you to inspect React components, states, props etc, as your app is running. Use this often to make sure your components are behaving correctly!
